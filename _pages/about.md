* Ankur Mali is an **Assistant Professor** in the department of computer science and engineering at the [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/). He was awarded Ph.D. in Informatics at Pennsylvania State University in 2022, under [Dr. Lee Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). Before this, he worked in industry and obtained a bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the University of Pune, India in 2013. He was also awarded  prestigious [**IVADO postdoctoral Fellowship**](https://ivado.ca/en/spotlight-on-our-academic-community/?programmes=postdoctoral-research-funding) to work with [**University of Montreal**](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/).

* At USF, he is the founder and scientific director of the Trustworthy knowledge-driven AI [**TKAI**](https://tkai-lab.github.io/) lab.

# Research Interests
* I have broad interests in natural language processing, neuro-symbloic AI and predictive coding. My research is mostly driven by two goals:
  ** Designing efficient and fundamental approaches to derive knowledge from data and encode human level reasnoning in to intelligents systems.
  ** Extending such model capabilities to generate interpretable, robust and fair representation.
I believe Neuro-symbolic AI and understanding of complex systems is a crutical steps towards desigining stable Artificial General Intelligence systems.
# Research Projects

  * **Formal method meet AI/Neuro-Symbloic AI**: My work is at the intersection of language, memory, and computation—spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and formal language theory. In particular, I design knowledge-guided interpretable deep learning systems focused on generating trustworthy information. Furthermore, I am also interested in investigating the mysterious success of deep learning in recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

  * **Predictive coding-inspired Neural Architectures**: Our lab, in collaboration with [NAC](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html), works on designing learning algorithms and computational architectures guided by theories of the brain and its functionality that emphasize solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal supervision, Reinforcement Learning, and sparsity (both in computer vision and natural language processing).

  * **Low Resource and Robust NLP**: In collaboration with our collaborator from [University of Mississippi](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/), we are working on designing low-resource Natural language processing (NLP) agents that are robust and capable of generating safe/ethical information. Such models are aimed to help under-represented groups.


## Notes to Prospective Students:
  * **Job Opening**: I am looking for a new Ph.D. student to begin in Spring/Fall 2023. All emails should have the title: Ph.D. Spring/Fall 2023. In brief words, Please provide details about why you wish to join our lab and what topics you wish to work on/explore.
  * Students at USF interested in doing an Independent Study or Master's thesis (seeking me as advisor) should also provide all the details highlighted above.
